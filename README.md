# Pipelined RISC-V Processor
In this repository of RISC-V, you will get to know the main modules of the MIPS Architecture with their codes, testbench and the design using the Verilog Language only. The purpose of this repository is to make an understable and easy-to-go code for the complex project i.e., RISC-V, where anyone with the basic knowledge on the Verilog can create.

## Software Used  
Xilinx Vivado version 2024.1

This is an industry level tool, which will produce the gate level design, schematic design and it can also implement the code in an FPGA kit by using bitstream generation.
